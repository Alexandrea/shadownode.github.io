We have banned a few items on our servers because of issues that required us to disable them. If you encounter a bug or any issue with items, please report it in our Discord support channel. If you notice an item is missing, please contact a staff member. We use a custom ban plugin, you can use ``/banneditems`` to view the banned items on your server. THe plugin allows us to ban items in ways that allow you to progress through the pack still. Craft, Place, Use and Near are all different ways items can be banned.

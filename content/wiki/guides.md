## Chunk Loaders
Modded Chunk Loaders have been disabled on ShadowNode servers globally, therefore we have added a plugin known as Better Chunk  Loaders to achieve their purpose. There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit ``F3+g``

The most basic command in the plugin is ``/betterchunkloader``, or just ``/bcl`` for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with. The interface will contain a list of active chunk loaders you currently own, along with some user-friendly icons. An example of the interface is below.
![Interface](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_interface.png)

### Always On vs Online Only
Always On is a chunk loader which is online 24/7 and will keep the chunk loaded. However, the chunk loader will stop loading the chunk after 3 days of activity. Once the owner returns, it will resume loading the chunk.The Online Only chunk loader will only load the chunk when the owner of the loader is online.

### Checking Your Balance
To check the number of chunks you may use/have used, you can click the ``Balance`` or run ``/bcl bal``. The interface will state the number of both Always Online and Online Only chunks that are currently active (used) and are available.
![Balance](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_balance.png)

### How to Create Chunk Loaders
From the main interface, you should click the ``Create`` icon or run ``/bcl create`` to begin the process of creating a Chunk Loader. An interface will open and should look like the following image.
![Create a Chunk Loader](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_create.png)

The interface will state the name of the chunk loader Owner. It will also give you the coordinates of the chunk that you are currently standing in. Please note that these coordinates are different than regular XYZ coordinates. To create an Always Online chunk loader or Online Only chunk loader, click their respective icons. You should be prompted with the following interface.
![Create a Chunk Loader](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_create2.png)

The ``Radius`` icons will determine the size of the chunk loader. You can only load as many chunks as your balance allows. Hovering over the icon will display how many chunks will be loaded with each radius upgrade.
![Radius](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_create3.png)

After you select your radius size, your chunk loader will be created. You will be shown a confirmation window which will display your name, loader id, and state. If you'd like to delete your loader and regain your chunk balance, click the ``Delete`` icon.
![Chunk Confirmation](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_created.png)

### How to View Active Chunk Loaders
Once you have Chunk Loaders active, running ``/bcl`` will contain some information regarding regarding your active chunk loaders. You can hover over the ``Chunk`` icon to view the coordinates of the chunk loader. Clicking ``View`` will pull up the same prompt that was displayed after you created your loader originally.
![BCL Balance](../../assets/images/bcl/bcl_list.png)

### How to Read Chunk Coordinates
To view the coordinates of the chunk you are currently in, press ``F3``. You will see the typical statistics of your game, which should resemble the image below. The value in the red box is your chunk coordinates.

## Claiming
All of our servers use the latest Grief Prevention plugin for claiming.

### How to Claim
To claim you can either use a Golden Shovel you make, or one provide to you when you first join the server (some servers do not start with the golden shovel or have had their claim tool changed). Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store. Before claiming any land, please make sure to check which method of claiming you currently are using, [2D or 3D](#2D-vs-3D). Once your method of choice is confirmed, we can begin claiming. If you are in 2D mode, right click two opposite corners of the intended claim. For 3D mode, right click two opposite corners, one at the lowest point in the claim, and the other at the highest point in the claim. You can right click the air or ground with a stick to see who claims the block you are looking at.

### 2D vs 3D
2D means that no what Y level you claim the blocks on, Grief Prevention will make your claim from bedrock to make build level. 3D will require you to claim your area in a cube and will only claim what is inside the cube.

### How to Subdivide Claims
Subdividing your claim means making smaller sections in the bigger claim to allow people to build/access certain parts of your base. To subdivide claims, hold your golden shovel and run the command ``subdivideclaims``. This changes your golden shovel to create smaller claims. This is always in 2D mode, but it reaches to the highest level of your main claim. When you select two corners you see iron blocks instead of golden blocks. To get out of subdivideclaims mode, scroll your mouse wheel off the golden shovel and then back onto it. This can be used to make towns and/or sell plots to other players for in-game currency.

## Crates

We use a plugin called HuskyCrates to manage our crates. Crates contain items, the quality of which depends on the tier of the crate. To open a create you must hold the crate key in your hand and right click the corresponding crate. You can obtain crate keys by either purchasing them from our [store](https://shop.shadownode.ca), or buy buying them in our token shop.

Some items on this list may not be on your server as some modpacks don't have all the mods as others.

## Summoning the Ender Dragon

To summon the Ender Dragon, you will need 43 blocks of obsidian in your inventory and 4 end crystals. Simply go to The End, and run the command `/portalplace` with the required materials in your inventory. Once the structure is built, place the 4 end crystals on each side of the structure and the ender dragon should spawn!

## How to Use Github Gist
While other copy and paste tools, like Pastebin or Hastebin, are more popular then Github Gist, Github Gist is one of the better copy and paste tools. It doesn't have a character count and it's just as easy to use as other tools. Using a copy and paste tool like Gist is recommended if you have issues with client crashes since it keeps the formatting of the log, and makes it easier to read the file without having to download it. 

1. Use [this](https://gist.github.com/) link.
2. Give the gist a title in the small "filename" window above the large text window.
3. Open the file you wish to share.
4. Use Ctrl+A to select the whole text and Ctrl+C to copy it.
5. Go on the Gist Page and use Ctrl+V to paste it in the large text window.
6. Click on "Create Secret Gist". The file you have may not be that important, but it's not necessary to share it with the whole world.
7. Copy the link from the gist website, and paste it anywhere you'd like!

## Offensive Skins
If you're reading this, there's a good chance that you've been hit with a ban that says "Your skin is offensive, please change it". You forgot to change your Hitler skin when you were trolling, don't worry! Even though you've quickly changed it, you still lost valuable playing time. 

Don't want that to happen to you? Just do one quick thing: Check your skin! If you haven't changed it in a while, it might be good to take a quick look in game by using F5 or a site like [NameMC](https://namemc.com).

If you've been banned, don't worry! Just create a ban appeal in the proper section of Discord and give us your username. Once staff verifies that your skin is no longer against our rules, you'll be unbanned!

### What qualifies as bad
 1. Anything relating to Nazi's or Communists
 2. Nudity - visible genitals of any kind

## Relocation
Crate relocation is a method that we have created in order to compensate for wiping servers. it will hold a **limited** number of items for you to be able to access them later. 
 
### Conditions to be capable of relocating
 1. Must be across servers wit the same mod pack, such as Stoneblock A to Stoneblock B
 2. May also be used to store some items to use after a map wipe
 3. **Cannot** be across different mod packs, such as Skyfactory to Beyond
 
If you run ``/relocate`` a message in chat will be triggered to warn you of a few common issues:
 1. It will warn you that if your player has a large number of items such as a full ME drive or a full bag, it **will crash** your game and you **may loose** the item/context of the items if the crash is not fixed. 
    1. *Anything with a sub-inventory (such as armor with a modifier) has a risk of being lost. To prevent this, please put them in the crate separately.*
2. If a certain mod/item has plans to be banned/removed from the pack there will be a warning.
    1. The purpose of this warning is for you to **NOT** include them in your crate because you **WILL** lose them.

![Warning](../../assets/images/relocate/relocate_command.png)

If you run ``/relocate crate`` an inventory similar to a chest will appear on your screen. You may drag items that you wish to save into the chest. *The chest does not save the order in which you place the items.* You may run the command again to open this inventory to take items out of it or to add more. In order to access the items after the wipe, or on the other server, run ``/relocate crate``

{{% notice warning %}}
There will be a deadline to when you can access your relocate crate. This applies to both adding items, and removing items. If you are relocating after a reset and you fail to take your items out of the crate in time, they will be removed. The deadline will be posted in the Discord server.

    - These two categories are for changing your in-game prefix and giving you a few neat perks. No in-game features are locked or require you to have certain ranks to progress, these perks are all just quality-of-life enhancements like ```/feed```, ``/fly``, ``/back`` or multiple homes. See [rank overview](../server info/ranks.md) for all ranks and their perks.

Our voting system is relatively simple and easy to understand. 

- We have 3 voting website we are listed on. Each of which you can use to vote on, once per day.
- You vote by filling in your Minecraft username in the text window and completing the Captcha.
- Voting gives you 100 Tokens per voting website, which can be used for in-game items or transactions with other users.

### Why should you vote?

- Voting increases our rank and reputation on those websites, which means there is a higher chance for new players to get interested in ShadowNode.
- The tokens you get from voting are a global form of currency which you can trade in for claimblocks, chunkloaders and other goodies on the servers you play on.
- We have a monthly giveaway of Steam Game Keys for permanent copies of certain games for the Top 3 Voters! Claim your key by making a support ticket in our Discord!
- Every vote supports us and is just as valuable to us as you supporting us via our store!

{{% notice note %}}
Rewards redeemed from the token shop are usually not globally shared. Your token balance is globally shared between all servers however.
{{% /notice %}}

### Where can I redeem my rewards?

- After voting you get a shoutout in-game confirming that your vote went through. This shoutout does not always show up client side, but other players see it.
- The rewards for your tokens can be claimed in the ``/tokenshop`` on your server.
- If you are one of the Top 3 Voters of the month message a staff member to get your Steam Game Key in the first week of the new month. The Voters can choose the game they want with Number 1 having the choice between all 3 titles and Number 2 being allowed to choose from the remaining games.
